# dtsman
your tool to automatically generate a .d.ts file into your localsystem for
roblox-ts
# Why
Currently, plugins to generate .d.ts code on an object exists, whats wrong with it?
1. It dosen't directly sync it to the file system
2. you will have to smash that generate button, copy paste it to your file system,
So i wanted something more automatic. Here it is.
# How do we use it?
very easily. firstly, you should install the .zip at releases
and unpack it,
it should look like this when you unpack it
